Track 1: BGA Hackathon Bounty ‚Äì Cybersecurity & Compliance for Public Good
In the wake of high-profile cybersecurity breaches‚Äîincluding the recent Bybit hack‚Äîthe need for proactive, blockchain-native threat detection is greater than ever. In response, the BGA sponsors this special track at the Block & Order: AI-Agents for Compliance Hackathon, inviting builders to create AI-powered blockchain compliance tools that target real-world, high-risk vulnerabilities in Web3 ecosystems.
üéØ The Challenge:
Build a prototype for an AI-agent-based blockchain security solution that can:
Identify and alert on-chain activity involving known scammer addresses or wallets linked through common patterns (e.g., chain-hopping, mixers, sudden token transfers).


Perform predictive network analysis to classify wallet addresses based on behavioral risk patterns‚Äîe.g., excessive token minting, dump cycles, rug pulls.
We encourage participants to work with known open datasets (e.g., Chainalysis alerts, Etherscan tags, ScamSniffer reports) and build tools that can surface suspicious transactions before major harm occurs. For this hackathon, a working prototype is all that is needed to showcase the features and how it works. 
üß† Focus Areas (pick one or both):

Agent-Based Scam Detection


Develop a lightweight on-chain AI agent that continuously scans activity and alerts the user when interacting with potentially fraudulent addresses based on existing scam databases and network indicators.


Predictive Risk Classifier for Wallets


Design a network analysis model (with optional AI enhancements) that can analyze wallet behavior and assign risk scores to addresses in real-time, enabling developers, exchanges, and users to avoid malicious actors.
üí° Why This Matters:
The blockchain industry continues to suffer from reputational damage due to fraud and scams. A security layer powered by AI agents, integrated natively with blockchains, can democratize trust and restore user confidence‚Äîespecially in high-risk regions or use cases like DeFi, NFT trading, and peer-to-peer transfers.
üßæ Definitions:


Suspicious Transactions:
 Transactions that exhibit patterns such as rapid large-volume transfers, interactions with flagged addresses, token honeypots, or significant deviation from historical behavior.


Known Scammer Patterns:
 Wallets involved in phishing campaigns, bridge exploits, token approval drainers, or laundering via mixers. Datasets may include sources like Chainabuse, De.Fi, SlowMist, and Etherscan‚Äôs tags.


üèÅ What a Good Prototype Can Look Like:


The AI agent is able to flag a transaction or wallet before interaction.


It can generate an explainable alert (e.g., ‚ÄúThis address was flagged due to connection with X scam pattern‚Äù).


Easy-to-integrate API or interface for builders and end-users.


Bonus: A dashboard showing live threat detection or simulation.
üí∞ Bounty Prize Pool: 3000 USDT
üèÖ Up to 2 winning teams will receive prizes after a judging process. The winner of the track will receive $2000 and the runner-up $1000.

About the BGA:
Launched in April 2024 by Bybit and global Web3 leaders, the Blockchain for Good Alliance (BGA) is a long-term collaborative non-profit initiative with key partners with the main goal to contribute to societal good by using blockchain technology to solve real-world problems. 
Our goal is to position blockchain as a tool with the capabilities to address some of the most pressing global challenges, aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.



Track 2: Set the standard with Project SPARC‚Äì Empowering Privacy with AI-Driven Compliance
Project SPARC
Project SPARC aims to strengthen the sovereignty and resilience of the European payment landscape by using public blockchain infrastructure to enable compliant, privacy-preserving payments. This open, collaborative initiative brings together a broad community to co-develop an open-source protocol that redefines the balance between regulatory compliance and uncompromised user privacy.
Project SPARC has adopted a public-private partnership model to explore user-driven, technological, and regulatory requirements for banks that want to serve as trusted access points to the decentralized world of digital money. The goal: define foundational standards for the financial industry while allowing institutions to build new services and business models bringing traditional finance and decentralised finance together..
üöÄ About the Track
The project is already developing a protocol that brings privacy onto Ethereum L1 via Privacy Pools as a first step. This track challenges you to build the component that enables selective disclosure of transactions through a network of guardians. These guardians‚Äîwhether institutions, individuals, or AI agents‚Äîserve as decentralized gatekeepers. A transaction can only be de-anonymized when a quorum of guardians validates a legitimate compliance need. This concept can be found in this paper.
As of now, no transaction data is available to train AI models as the project is still in development phase. Therefore, your solution should be hypothesis-driven and extensible, ready for future implementation and scaling. 


üîπ Your Mission:

Develop an AI-agent-driven blockchain prototype that empowers guardians to:
Protect user privacy by default


Enable on-demand de-anonymization only in response to confirmed regulatory breaches


Operate transparently and fairly through a quorum-based decision model


Participate based on a clear and sustainable incentive mechanism

üîπ Focus Areas:
1. Guardian-Based Selective Disclosure
 Design a governance model where transaction de-anonymization requires a quorum of guardians, each representing different institutional or societal interests (e.g., regulators, financial institutions, civic entities).
No single actor should be able to trigger disclosure alone


Guardians may optionally request additional context, such as verifiable credentials (VCs), to assess whether de-anonymization is justified
2. Incentive Design for Guardians
 Propose a tokenomics or reputational incentive model that ensures reliable and honest guardian behavior. Incentives may include:
Monetary: monthly allowance or usage-based rewards


Reputation-based: linked to personal or institutional credibility


Trust-based: participation of entities with public responsibility (e.g., supervisory authorities)
3. Smart Data Hypotheses and Risk Detection
Hypothesize the types of behavioral or transactional data required for AI agents and guardians to flag non-compliant activity in real time. Consider how blockchain analytics or risk scoring could support decision-making.
4. Alignment with Real-World Standards
Ensure that your compliance logic can be mapped to frameworks like the NVB Baseline Expected Transaction Profile or similar KYC/AML best practices.
5. Scalability & Integration
Design your solution to integrate smoothly with third-party regulatory tooling and scale across both DeFi platforms and traditional financial institutions.

üí∞ Bounty Prize Pool: 3000 USDT
üèÖ Up to 2 winning teams will receive prizes after a judging process. The winner of the track will receive $2000 and the runner-up $1000. 
At Project SPARC‚Äôs discretion, winners may also qualify for exclusive benefits including:
 ‚úÖ Access to mentorship sessions
 ‚úÖ Follow-up development support
 ‚úÖ Opportunities to present their solutions to leading financial institutions and regulators
üõ† Track Rules:
 ‚úî Open to all teams building open source AI-driven compliance solutions on blockchain
 ‚úî Solutions must be blockchain-agnostic (use any chain that fits your use case).
 ‚úî Submit a pitch deck and recorded demo via the event platform before the deadline.
 ‚úî All projects must align with our mission of empowering privacy while ensuring robust compliance.
üß† Judging Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated based on the following:
‚úÖ Technical Feasibility (25%) ‚Äì Is your AI agent capable of privacy-aware, real-time compliance monitoring?
‚úÖ Innovation (20%) ‚Äì Does the solution advance the future of compliant privacy tech?
‚úÖ Regulatory Compliance (20%) ‚Äì Is it aligned with FATF Travel Rule, AML guidelines, and banking standards?
‚úÖ Privacy & Ethics (15%) ‚Äì Does it minimize risks while protecting user autonomy and anonymity?
‚úÖ Pitch & Presentation (20%) ‚Äì Is the solution well-articulated, strategic, and actionable?

AI Agent Hackathon Participant Guide
Welcome to the Block and Order: AI-agents for Compliance Hackathon
This hackathon challenges you to build and deploy a fully functioning AI agent that aligns with the objectives of your selected track. Whether you're focused on public-sector compliance, fraud detection, or privacy-preserving disclosure, your solution should go beyond just writing code: it must run on real infrastructure, process meaningful data, and demonstrate real-world utility.
Your agent should also adhere to relevant AML regulations and other compliance requirements specific to your track, and you won‚Äôt be on your own. Throughout the event, you‚Äôll have access to domain experts who can support you on these aspects and help you fine-tune your solution.
By the end of the hackathon, your team will present a cloud-deployed agent that clearly demonstrates its decision-making capabilities within the context of your track‚Äôs theme.
Context: Why We Build AI Agents for Compliance
Fraud, financial crime, and privacy risks are growing concerns in today‚Äôs increasingly digital economy. As blockchain technology becomes a foundation for financial transactions, and AI evolves to drive automation and decision-making, new opportunities and responsibilities emerge.
Blockchain offers transparency, security, and traceability, while AI agents can enhance regulatory oversight and operational efficiency. Together, these technologies have the potential to reshape compliance, making it more scalable, accurate, and privacy-conscious.
 From detecting wallet-based scam patterns and classifying risk behavior to enabling guardian-based selective disclosure and protecting user anonymity,, your work has the power to:
Uncover patterns of suspicious transactions and financial crime


Identify threats before they cause harm


Automate regulatory processes at scale


Preserve privacy while enabling responsible oversight


Stronger compliance and fraud prevention are key to restoring trust in Web3, accelerating adoption, and aligning innovation with public good.
At this hackathon, your mission is to design and deploy AI agents that advance this vision‚Äîsolutions that are not only functional but responsible, compliant, and impactful.

What‚Äôs Expected of You
You will design and build an AI agent that combines model intelligence with decision logic and system integration. Each team is expected to:
Address the goals of one of the two tracks (see below)


Use real-world data and infrastructure to power the solution


Ensure the solution aligns with relevant compliance or public-good criteria


Deploy and demo a working version of your agent by the end of the event (MVP) 

Understanding the AI Agent
In this hackathon, an ‚ÄúAI agent‚Äù is more than just an LLM. It is a system that can:
Process inputs via messaging interfaces, APIs, or data streams


Reason over data using ML/LLM models


Take actions or produce outputs aligned with a goal (e.g. flagging suspicious transactions, issuing a verifiable credential, querying the blockchain)


An agent typically consists of:
A core model (e.g. DeepSeek, LLaMA, Mistral, OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Qwen)


An orchestration layer (e.g. custom code, LangChain, Autogen, MCP, Semantic Kernel)


Memory and context handling (e.g. embeddings, databases, prompts)


External tools or data connections (e.g. RPC nodes, compliance APIs, VC verifiers)


You are free to choose your architecture and stack, as long as the result is demonstrable and solves the challenge effectively.
Model Approaches: You Choose
Depending on your team‚Äôs strengths, you can take one of the following approaches:
1. Use a Pre-Trained Model
 Focus on orchestration, logic, and integration. Ideal for teams who want to prioritize speed and function. Examples: OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Qwen.
2. Fine-Tune an Existing Model
