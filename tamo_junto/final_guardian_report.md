### 1. Regulatory Body  
**Vote:** YES  
**Justification:** The Regulatory Body supports disclosure based on the legitimate regulatory interest that arises from the transaction’s interaction with a new exchange, OpenOcean. This disclosure aligns with AML/CFT obligations by enabling enhanced due diligence, identification of involved parties, and risk assessments. Transparency in monitoring new exchange interactions is critical for preventing financial crimes such as money laundering and fraud, thus bolstering the integrity and stability of the financial ecosystem.

### 2. Major Financial Institution  
**Vote:** YES  
**Justification:** The Major Financial Institution agrees with disclosing the transaction details, citing alignment with institutional risk management and AML regulatory standards. The institution views the interaction with OpenOcean as requiring transparency to assess the transaction’s legitimacy, detect suspicious activity, and mitigate risks associated with lesser-known exchanges. Disclosure serves to protect the institution’s regulatory standing and reputation by facilitating compliance and effective risk mitigation.

### 3. Privacy Advocacy Organization  
**Vote:** ABSTAIN  
**Justification:** The Privacy Advocacy Organization is cautious and refrains from endorsing disclosure without stronger justification. They argue that interaction with a new exchange alone does not substantiate suspicion or risk sufficient to override essential financial privacy rights. Disclosure without concrete evidence of wrongdoing or a formal legal mandate could lead to unwarranted invasions of privacy and set problematic precedents. The organization emphasizes protecting individual privacy by requiring clearer, more specific grounds before any disclosure.

### 4. Independent Auditor  
**Vote:** YES  
**Justification:** The Independent Auditor supports disclosure, highlighting that the request meets criteria of validity, proportionality, and adherence to AML/CFT protocols. Monitoring transactions involving new exchanges like OpenOcean is a valid risk management approach to deter financial crime. Disclosure is considered proportionate and justified, helping compliance officers verify legitimacy and identify involved parties, thereby maintaining stability and compliance within the ecosystem.
